Project 2: NN, Perceptron and Cluster ModelsTitle: Document and Tabular Data Classification using Clustering and Neural Networks

Objective:To apply unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques for clustering and classification tasks using document text data and 2D tabular datasets.

Key Methods & Models Used:

Expectation-Maximization (EM) for soft and hard document clustering

TF-IDF Vectorization and Cosine Similarity for text feature extraction

Perceptron and 3-layer Neural Networks (MLPClassifier) for classification

Autoencoders for unsupervised feature learning

PCA for 2D visualization of clusters

Deliverables & Results:

Successfully clustered documents into 4 groups using both hard and soft EM algorithms

Perceptron gave higher error, confirming non-linear separability of tabular data

Neural networks achieved best test accuracy with 10 hidden units and 0.01 learning rate

Autoencoders reduced reconstruction error as hidden neurons increased

Self-taught networks were built by augmenting input with encoder features

Performance comparison plots highlighted overfitting at larger network sizes

Final models delivered accurate and visual insights into data structure and classification performance
