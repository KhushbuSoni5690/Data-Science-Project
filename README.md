Project 1: Regressors and Bayesian Classifiers
Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning
Project Brief: Developed and implemented a machine learning model for regression on a diabetes
dataset to predict diabetes, utilizing regularization parameters. Built a customized Bayesian classifier
with a 96% accuracy rate.

Responsibilities:
• Loaded and cleansed the dataset using Python (Google Colab) for preprocessing.
• Built and implemented a Bayesian classifier and performed regression modeling.
• Tested the model and achieved a test accuracy of 96%.
• Created visualizations comparing the training and test accuracy to provide insights
