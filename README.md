**Project 3: Food Delivery Prediction with Spark (Batch)**
Created a Spark pipeline using RDD and PySpark SQL to predict delivery times. Engineered features and trained models, with Random Forest delivering highest accuracy and F1-score.

---

**Project 4: Real-Time Delivery Prediction with Spark Streaming**
Developed a structured streaming pipeline to predict delivery time buckets. Used Logistic Regression and Random Forest, evaluated via streaming metrics and visualized real-time outputs.

---

**Project 5: End-to-End Streaming with Kafka and Spark**
Built a Kafka-based real-time pipeline with Spark consumers and ML model integration. Simulated order data and streamed predictions, demonstrating full-cycle real-time analytics.
